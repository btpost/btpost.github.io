		Hello! I'm Brad. This is my blog. I've recently come into a lot of free time (I quit my job), 
		so I made this blog to keep track of the stuff I'm doing. I got a B.S. in Math in 2018, and I
		started programming about 9 years ago, when I was 14. <br/><br/>


		Lately, I've been doing a lot of math, and a bit of programming. There's not much here yet, but I'm working on it. Have a look around, I guess.<br/><br/>

		Here's a copy of my <a href="/assets/docs/Post_Bradley_Resume.pdf" class="underline hover:no-underline">resume</a>, if you're so inclined. I'm sure you can also see the links to my Linkedin and GitHub profiles.
		<br/><br/>

		Have a nice visit!
