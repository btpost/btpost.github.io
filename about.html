		Hello! I'm Brad. This is my blog. I've recently come into a lot of free time (I quit my job), 
		so I made this blog to keep track of the stuff I'm doing. I got a B.S. in Math in 2018, and I
		started programming about 8 years ago, when I was 15. <br/><br/>

		If you're a potential employer, I reccommend my posts in the Programming and Electronics sections, where I 
		document my projects. Those posts are a good demonstration of my hands on skills. <br/><br/>

		If you like math, check out my math posts. I try to make sure that they're reasonably accessible, but some
		familiarity with set-builder notation and symbolic logic will come in handy. Also, potential employers, these
		posts demonstrate my abstract reasoning skills.<br/><br/>

		Here's a copy of my <a href="/assets/docs/Post_Bradley_Resume.pdf" class="underline hover:no-underline">resume</a>, if you're so inclined. I'm sure you can also see the links to my Linkedin and GitHub profiles.
		<br/><br/>

		Have a nice visit!
